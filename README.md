# Fulton Schools Spoken News Theme for WordPress #

A theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) from the [Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering](http://engineering.asu.edu) at [Arizona State University](http://asu.edu). Intended to provide a managable news feed for an Amazon skill for Alexa to be consumed by residents of the Tooker House. 

## Notes ##

This is a theme for WordPress hosted by ASU, but it is not ASU Brand Standard compliant. To build a web standards compliant website, there are a number of other products available. See [wordpress.asu.edu](https://wordpress.asu.edu) for a list of WebSpark alternatives. 

Contains a Custom Post Type called `spokennews` and several theme files to render the correct output for the Alexa skill.
- The machine-readable page is the CPT achive page located at `/spokennews`
- A human-readable page can be rendered by creating a page using the **Spoken News for Humans** page template.
